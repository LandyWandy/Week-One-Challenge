# Week-One-Challenge

## Description
This is the first week homework assignment of my coding bootcamp at UT Austin, my assignment was to refactor the code-base of the existing website "Horiseon" without changing any functionality.
## What I learned
> - When I was trying to push my first refactor of the code-base I accidentally pulled my repository over my edited local repository so I definitely learned not to do that again. 
> - I editing all of the code in this repository out of "main" so my commits do not show for some reason
> - As I learn more about CSS formatting I may continue to iterate on this website as to continuously apply my learnings to this refactor
## What I did
>### HTML
> - I changed all the "div" values with ones that are semantic.
> - I added alt attributes to all images.
> - Changed the title element to provide a more descriptive and concise title
>### CSS
> - I merged a lot of classes that applied the same styles
